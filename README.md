# Project J-Text

J-Text is my attempt to go back to my roots and try and make a non-game related application. 

This application is meant to eventually be a full-featured Text Editor made with mixes of raw Java17 API and OpenGL capabilities.

For now, it is simply in its baby stages. Use at your own risk!!
